Hi! Welcome to the Expanded Ai Tasks Loader Mod Readme and thanks for downloading.

This mod acts as a shared loader for the ExpandedAiTasks.dll that accompanies it. 
The .dll adds aiTasks that I use to develop my mods that the base game doesn't support natively.

Getting Started:

========================================================================================================================

FOR PLAYERS:
1. Just put the zip file in your mods folder, like any other mod.
2. You're good to go!

========================================================================================================================

FOR MODDERS:
If you're planning on integrating tasks from ExpandedAiTasks.dll into your mod there are two ways of doing it: 
	1. Using this Loader Mod.
	2. Doing your own .dll integration.

There are pros and cons to both approaches:
	The Loader Mod Method:
	In this method, you let this mod do the heavy lifting for you. You simply reference the AiTasks it registers.
		Pros:
			1. If you use this loader mod, you don't have to write any code, your mod can just reference the AiTasks in your .json files and it will work.
			2. You don't have to worry about compatibility with any other mod that also uses the loader mod, since all the AiTasks are registered in the same place.
		Cons:
			1. Your mod won't work properly if players don't have the ExpandedAiTasksLoader mod installed. You'll have to point people to this mod and tell them to download it so
			they will have the AiTasks registered when you reference them. (i.e. Your mod won't be a standalone mod).

	Doing your own .dll integration:
	In this method, You include the ExpandedAiTasks.dll in your project and register it's AiTasks in your Core ModSystem.
		Pros:
			1. Your mod is totally self-contained and people won't need to download the loader for your mod to work.
		Cons:
			1. You need to know enough code to integrate the dll. (See next section).

========================================================================================================================

Integrating ExpandedAiTasks.dll into your mod

	1. Add ExpandedAiTasks.dll as a reference to your project.
	2. In your Core ModSystem .cs file include 'using ExpandedAiTasks;'
	3. In your Core ModSystem class, in the public override void Start(ICoreAPI api) function:
		a. Call ExpandedAiTasksDeployment.Deploy(api);
		
		Example:
		public override void Start(ICoreAPI api)
        	{
            		base.Start(api);
            		ExpandedAiTasksDeployment.Deploy(api);
        	}

	4. At this point, you should now be able to reference this AiTask in your .json files.
	5. When packaging your mod, do not forget to include ExpandedAiTasks.dll in your zip file (Not to be confused with ExpandedAiTasksLoader.dll)

AI Tasks Documentation:

========================================================================================================================
	AiTaskShootProjectileAtEntity ( registered as "shootatentity"" )
		
		This AiTask tells an Ai to shoot a specified projectile at a target with the specified settings.

		Note: This system can lead moving target and arc shots properly over distance to account for gravity. 
		HOWEVER! It is important to note that this will not work properly unless you use a projectile with very specific PassivePhysics Behavior settings.
		The projectile must have a gravityFactor of 1.0 and a airDragFactor of 0.0, which none of the vanilla projectiles have.
		To accomplish this, you must create a dummy projectile entity that the Ai will fire. If you want the projectile to be a vanilla item when picked up set the projectileItem field to a vanilla projectile code.
		An example asset of dummyarrow.json is included in this zip.
		 

	json Settings

		int durationMs: The duration of the ranged attack in milliseconds.
		int releaseAtMs: The time at which the projectile is fired in milliseconds.
		float minDist: The minimum distance at which the attack can occur (measured in blocks).
		float maxDist: The maximum distance at which the attack can occur (measured in blocks).
		float minRangeDistOffTarget: The projectile's maximum distance off target at minimum range (measured in blocks).
		float maxRangeDistOffTarget: The projectile's maximum distance off target at maximum range (measured in blocks).
		float maxVelocity: The absolute maximum velocity of the projectile.
		float newTargetDistOffTarget: The projectile's maximum distance off target when the shooter has just acquired a new target (measured in blocks).
		float newTargetZeroingTime: The time (in seconds) over which a shooter zeros his aim and newTargetDistOffTarget lerps to a value of 0.0. 
		float damage: How much damage the attack deals when the projectile hits its target.
		float damageFalloffPercent: The percent of the damage value that is retained at damageFalloffEndDist.
		float damageFalloffStartDist: The distance at which damage begins to falloff (measured in blocks).
		float damageFalloffEndDist: The distance at which damage is fully reduced by damageFalloffPercent and will not falloff further (measured in blocks).
		string projectileItem: The code of the item stack for the dummy projectile.
		sting dummyProjectile: The code of a custom dummy projectile that has a gravityFactor of 1.0 and an airDragFactor of 0.0 in its PassivePhysics behavior. leadTarget and arc shots will not function unless the dummy projectile is configured properly.
		bool projectileRemainsInWorld: Determines whether or not the projectile will remain in the world after impacting a surface.
		float projectileBreakOnImpactChance: The percentage chance that a projectile will break when impacting a surface is projectileRemainInWorld is true.
		bool stopIfPredictFriendlyFire: If true the Ai will interrupt its ranged attack if it detects a friendly herd member running into the line of fire.	
		bool leadTarget: If true, the Ai will lead and fire ahead of their target based on their target's movement velocity.
      		bool arcShots: If true, if the initial velocity of the projectile is too slow to fire directly at the target, the Ai wil arc the shot upwards to compensate for gravity.

            	float guardAgroChaseDist: The max distance an Ai can chance an agressor away from its guard target before returning to follow mode.
		bool guardHerd: If true the Ai will select a guard target from among its herd members, use entityCodes to specify valid entities to guard. If the guard target is killed, the Ai will try to find a replacement within its herd.
            	bool aggroOnProximity: If true the Ai will attack if a player gets within aggroProximity of the guard target. The player does not need to be agressive to trigger an attack.
